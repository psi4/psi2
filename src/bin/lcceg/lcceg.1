.SH NAME
lcceg \- compute the coupled cluster energy and wavefunction

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B lcceg
is used to compute the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD)
energy and wavefunction for
atoms and molecules with a closed shell reference state.
It is intended for use only on very large chemical systems, for
which
.B cceg
uses too much memory.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B lcceg
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B LCCEG
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
A character string to be included in the output.  This string is not
used by the program.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The point group of the molecule as is described in the \fBinput\fP program
manual pages.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The type of correlation energy calculation.  This must be
.B CCSD
(coupled cluster with single and double excitations from the reference).
There is no default.

.IP "\fBDERTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
If this parameter is given its value must be
.BR NONE .
If gradients are desired then use the
.B cceg
program.  The default is
.BR NONE .

.IP "\fBFROZEN_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation from which there will be no excitations.
The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
The default is the zero vector.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation into which there will be no excitations.
The default is the zero vector.

.IP "\fBNCSF =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of cluster coefficients to print out. The
default is 20.

.IP "\fBMAXITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum number of iterations. The default is 20
for \fBDERTYPE = NONE\fP and 30 for \fBDERTYPE = FIRST\fP.

.IP "\fBCONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The convergence criterion is
.if n 10**(\-\fIinteger\fP).
.if t 10\s-2\u(\-\fIinteger\fP)\d\s0.
The default is 7
for \fBDERTYPE = NONE\fP and 10 for \fBDERTYPE = FIRST\fP.

.IP "\fBRESTART =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The calculation will restart from the old wavefunction
if \fIboolean\fP is true.  Possible values
for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is false.

.LP
There are also parameters for controlling DIIS, however, these
these are unneccessary for the normal use of Psi.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
This is a sample input for a CCSD calculation in
.if n C2V
.if t C\s-1\d2v\u\s0
symmetry
with the lowest energy totally symmetric orbital frozen:

.DS
  default: (
    label = "C2V test case -- one frozen core orbital"
    symmetry = c2v
    wfn = ccsd
    frozen_docc = (1 0 0 0)
    frozen_uocc = (0 0 0 0)
    )
.DE

.LP
It will almost never be necessary to include more input parameters than
are shown in the above example.
