.SH NAME
cczv \- compute the coupled cluster Z-vector

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B cczv
is used to computed the coupled cluster Z-vector.  This
vector is required in the computation of first derivatives
of the coupled cluster energy.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B cczv
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B CCZV
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
A character string to be included in the output.  This string is not
used by the program.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The point group of the molecule as is described in the \fBinput\fP program
manual pages.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The type of correlation energy calculation.  This must be one of
.B CCSD
(coupled cluster with single and double excitations from the reference),
.B CCD
(coupled cluster with double excitations),
.B CCSDT1
(CCSDT-1),
and
.B CCSD_T
(CCSD(T)).
The CCSDT-1 method is not recommended.  The CCSD(T) method should
be used if the effects of triples are desired.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBDERTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This must be set to
.B FIRST
or the program will abort.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which should not excited from.  The default is the
zero vector.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which should not excited into.  The default is the
zero vector.

.IP "\fBNCSF =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of Z-vector coefficients to print out. The
default is 20.

.IP "\fBMAXITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum number of iterations. The default is 30.

.IP "\fBCONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The convergence criterion is 10**(\-\fIinteger\fP).  The default is 10.

.IP "\fBRESTART =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The calculation will restart if \fIboolean\fP is true.  Possible values
for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is false.

.LP
There are also parameters for controlling DIIS, however, these
these are unneccessary for the normal use of Psi.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
This is a sample input for a CCSD calculation in
.if n C2V
.if t C\s-1\d2v\u\s0
symmetry
with the lowest energy totally symmetric orbital frozen:

.DS
  default: (
    label = "C2V test case -- one frozen core orbital"
    wfn = ccsd
    dertype = first
    frozen_docc = (1 0 0 0)
    frozen_uocc = (0 0 0 0)
    )
.DE

.LP
It will be almost never be necessary to include more input parameters than
are shown in the above example.  Moreover, once the input for the
.B cceg
program has been set up, it is usually unnecessary to provide any more
input for the
.B cczv
program.

.LP
Another example, this time of a large calculation with a
restart from the old Z-vector:

.DS
  default: (
    label = "C2V test case -- three frozen core orbitals"
    symmetry = c2v
    wfn = ccsd
    dertype = first
    frozen_docc = (2 0 1 0)
    frozen_uocc = (0 0 0 0)
    )

  cczv: (
    memory = (24.0 MB)
    restart = yes
    )
.DE
