.SH NAME
intco \- definition of internal coordinates

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B intco
section of the input is used to define the internal coordinates
used by \fBintder\fP(1) and \fBbmat\fP(1).  These internal coordinates consist
of two types,
.I simple
internal coordinates and
.I symmetrized
internal coordinates.  The symmetrized internal coordinates are
Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations of the simple internal coordinates.
For a thorough discussion of SALC's it is suggested that you read
Cotton's 
.I Chemical Applications of Group Theory.


.SH SIMPLE INTERNAL COORDINATES
.LP
The following types of simple internal coordinates are valid:
.iO     TYPE
.iV         "STRE"   "for bond stretching coordinates"
.iV         "INVR"   "for inverse bond length coordinates (\fBbmat\fP only)"
.iV         "BEND"   "for bond angle coordinates"
.iV         "OUT"    "for out-of-plane coordinates"
.iV         "TORS"   "for torsion coordinates"
.iV         "LIN1"
for the deformation of a linear chain of atoms in
the plane of a fourth atom (\fBbmat\fP only, see the \fBbmat\fP manual page for
the input required to specify the dummy atoms)
.iV         "LIN2"
is like LIN1, but the deformation is perpendicular
to the plane of the four atoms
.iV         "SPF"    
Simons-Parr-Finlan coordinate for bond length i.e.
.if n (r-r0)/r.
.if t (r-r\s-2\d0\u\s0)/r.
(\fBintder\fP only)


.LP
The simple internal coordinates are entered as:
.DS

  \fBTYPE \fP= ( 
    (\fIindex A B \fP<\fIC\fP> <\fID\fP> <\fIst\fP>)
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  ) (\fRrepeat this until
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  all simples of this
    (  "   " "   "  "   "  )  type are defined)
    )
.DE
.LP
where
.I index
is a label used in the SYMM and ASYMM vectors,
.I A-D
are atom labels, and
.I st
is an optional flag used by \fBintder\fP.  
Note, the indices must run from 1 to \fInsim \fPwhere
nsim is the total number of simple internal coordinates.
The atom labels are defined as follows:
.iO
For STRE, the coordinate is the A-B bond distance, and the order
of A and B does not matter.  (C and D must not be given.)
.iO
For INVR, the coordinate is the A-B bond inverse, and the order
of A and B does not matter.  (C and D must not be given.)
.iO
For SPF, the coordinate is the A-B bond distance, and the order
of A and B does not matter.  SPF is different from all other simples
in that C, if specified, is a \fIreal \fPrather than an integer.  C, if
given, is the reference bond length 
.if n r0.
.if t r\s-2\d0\u\s0.
If you wish to specify st
with this type of coordinate, you must include C.
.iO
For BEND, it is the A-B-C bond angle.  A and C can be exchanged
but the central atom must be B.  (D must not be given.)
.iO
For OUT,  the coordinate is the angle between the AB vector and
the plane containing the angle C-B-D.  The coordinate is
positive if A is on the same side of the plane as the
vector BC X BD.  Note that the central atom comes second
here and that C and D can be exchanged but that this
changes the sign of the coordinate.
.iO
For TORS, the coordinate is defined as the angle between the
planes ABC and BCD.  Note that ABCD and DCBA are
equivalent.
.iO
For LIN1, the coordinate is the collinear bending of the linear
chain of atoms ABC in the the plane which contains D.  The
sign is positive if A and C move towards D.  The atom D is a dummy atom
given in the DUMMY_ATOMS array.  See bmat(1) or intder(1) for a
description of the DUMMY_ATOMS array.
.iO
For LIN2, the coordinate is the bending of ABC perpendicular to
the plane which contains D.  The sign is positive if A and
C move in the direction of the vector product BD X BA.
The atom D is a dummy atom given in the DUMMY_ATOMS array.  See bmat(1) 
or intder(1) for a description of the DUMMY_ATOMS array.

.LP
So, for example, the simple internal coordinates for water would be:
.DS

intco: (
  stre = (
   (1 1 2)
   (2 1 3))
  bend = (
   (3 2 1 3))
 )

.DE
.LP
Note that the indices run from 1-3.  If coordinate testing were to be done
in \fBintder\fP for coordinates 1 and 3, then the coordinates would look like this:

intco: (
  stre = (
   (1 1 2 1)
   (2 1 3 0))
  bend = (
   (3 2 1 3 1))
 )

.DE

.SH SYMMETRIZED INTERNAL COORDINATES

.LP
The definition of symmetrized internal coordinates is a little more
complex.  A \fBSYMM \fParray is constructed which is made up of
internal coordinate vectors which consist of a character
label for the coordinate, an \fIinteger_vector
\fPspecifying which simples make up the
coordinate, and an optional \fIreal_vector \fPof coefficients.
Thus, in our water example, the 3N-6 symmetrized coordinates would be:
.DS

intco: (
  stre = (
   (1 1 2)
   (2 1 3))
  bend = (
   (3 2 1 3))

  symm = (
    ("c-h symm st" (1 2) (1.0 1.0))
    ("ch2 bend" (3 1 2))
    ("c-h asymm st" (1 -2)(1.0 1.0))
    )
  )

.DE
.LP
There are several important things to notice.  First, the coefficients do 
not have to be specified.  If they are not, they default to 1.0.  Second,
if a negative combination is desired, the negative sign appears before
the simple coordinate index rather than the coefficient.  Finally, the
labels must appear in quotes, and \fImust \fPbe present.  They are used
for print out in \fBintder\fP.

Finally, it is possible to split up the symmetrized coordinates into a SYMM
vector and an ASYMM vector, with the SYMM vector containing only the
totally symmetric irreducible representation.  This is useful geometry
optimizations where only the totally symmetric irrep is necessary, but where
one might want to set up all symmetrized coordinates at one time.
So, the water example becomes:
.DS

intco: (
  stre = (
   (1 1 2)
   (2 1 3))
  bend = (
   (3 2 1 3))

  symm = (
    ("c-h symm st" (1 2) (1.0 1.0))
    ("ch2 bend" (3 1 2))
    )
  asymm = (
    ("c-h asymm st" (1 -2)(1.0 1.0))
    )
  )
