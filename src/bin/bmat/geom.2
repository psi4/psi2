.SH NAME
geom \- geometry file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.pN GEOM
file contains geometries as written by the \fBBmat\fP(1) program.
This file is used by many of the PSI codes.  The first line of this
file must begin with two '%' signs, and may contain comments.
The second line is a comment line, beginning with one '%' sign.
The third line begins the GEOMETRY vector.  The GEOMETRY vector
contains NATOM vectors of the type (x y z), where x, y, and z are the
Cartesian coordinates of each atom.  Subsequent geometries are in the same
format, each geometry being separated by a line containing a '%' sign.
Thus the
.pN GEOM
file will look like this after a geometry optimization:

All programs which use the
.pN GEOM
file, read the first geometry found, thus the geometry from iteration 4
would be the current geometry.
