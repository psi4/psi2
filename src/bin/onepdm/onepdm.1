.SH NAME
onepdm \- constructs the CI one particle density matrix

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B onepdm
may be used to construct the CI one particle density matrix,
to form the CI natural orbitals, and to perform an analysis of the
CI wavefunction.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B onepdm
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B ONEPDM
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBNCSF =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This specifies how many configurations state functions are to be
listed in the output.  The default is 20.

.IP "\fBROOT1 =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of the first CI root for which \fBonepdm\fP is to be run.
The default is 1.

.IP "\fBNUMROOTS =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of CI roots for which \fBonepdm\fP is to
be run.  The default is 1.

.IP "\fBMK_OPDM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, the one particle density matrix will be formed and written to
.pN OUTPUT.
The default is FALSE, unless either WRTNOS or WRTOPM are TRUE, in which case
MK_OPDM defaults to TRUE.

.IP "\fBWRTNOS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If this is true, the symmetry orbital to approximate natural orbital
transformation matrix is written to
.pN FILE30 .
This file is where the coupled cluster and configuration interaction
transformation programs read the molecular orbital coefficients, so
if a transformation routine is run after
.B onepdm
with \fBWRTNOS = YES\fP is run, then the approximate
natural orbitals will be used instead of the SCF orbitals.
The default is false.

.IP "\fBWRTOPDM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If this is true, then the one particle density matrix is writen to
.pN FILE40 .
In this case, the \fBmaster\fP program must be run before \fBonepdm\fP.
This option must be true if the
.B lag
program is not run for the \fBciprop\fP program to work properly.
The default is FALSE, unless WRTNOS = TRUE, in which case the default is TRUE.

.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBonepdm\fP:

.IP \fBNOMO\fP
Prints out the natural orbital to molecular orbital transformation matrix.

.IP \fBNOSO\fP
Prints out the natural orbital to symmetry orbital transformation matrix.

.IP \fBOPDMSO\fP
Prints out the one particle density matrix in the symmetry orbital basis.

.IP \fBOPDMMO\fP
Prints out the one particle density matrix in the molecular orbital basis.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following example will write the approximate natural orbitals
over the SCF orbitals in
.pN FILE30
, print the natural orbitals in terms of the symmetry orbitals to
the output, but will not print the one-particle density matrix in the
MO basis to the output:

.DS
  onepdm: (
    wrtnos = yes
    print = ((on noso)(off opdmmo))
    )
.DE
