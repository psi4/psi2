.SH NAME
normco \- vibrational analysis from Cartesian force constants

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B normco
transforms the Cartesian second derivatives into normal
coordinates and performs a vibrational frequency analysis.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B normco
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B NORMCO
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:


.IP "\fBIR_INT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then read in dipole derivative information from 
.pN FILE17
and calculate IR intensities.  The default is true.
If IR_INT is true, and 
.pN FILE17
is empty, IR_INT is reset to false.

.IP "\fBRAMAN_INT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then read in polarizability derivative information from 
.pN FILE18
and calculate RAMAN intensities.  The default is false.
If RAMAN_INT is true, and 
.pN FILE18
is empty, RAMAN_INT is reset to false.

.IP "\fBISOTOPES =\fP \fIreal_array\fP"
The \fIreal_array\fP is a vector of isotopic masses for each isotopomer
for which frequencies are desired.  Each element of this vector is
another vector, containing the NATOM masses.
.B normco
always calculates the non-substitued freqencies, so it is not necessary to
include a line for the non-substitued species.  For example, to get the
frequencies for
.if n H2O
.if t H\s-2\d2\u\s0O
,
.if n D2O
.if t D\s-2\d2\u\s0O
, and
.if n D2O^18
.if t D\s-2\d2\u\s0O\s-2\u18\d\s0
, one would enter the following:

.DS
normco:(
  isotopes = (
    (15.99491 2.014102 2.014102)
    (17.99916 2.014102 2.014102)
    )
  )
.DE
ISOTOPES defaults to the zero vector.

.\" ---------------------------------------- Uncommonly used input here:
.LP
There are also a large number of less commonly used input parameters.
If you do not understand what the following options mean, then
make sure that they do not appear in your input.  The defaults will
work in the overwhelming majority of cases.
These are specified with the following keywords:

.IP "\fBREAD_GEOM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then the geometry is read from the top of the
.pN GEOM
file.  Otherwise, the last geometry in
.pN FILE11
is used.  The default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBNVIB =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of vibrational degrees of freedom.  This is used in the
calculation of the zero-point vibrational energy.  NVIB defaults to
3N-5 where N is the number of atoms.  This is normally ok, since
any mode whose frequency is below ZPVE_LIM (see below) will not be included.

.IP "\fBZPVE_LIM =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The threshold to include frequencies in the calculation of the zero-point
vibrational energy is set to \fIinteger\fP.  The default is 20.

.IP "\fBITHERM =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is the sigma used for the rotational partition function.  The default is 1.

.IP "\fBIQELEC =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This integer gives the degeneracy of the ground electronic state.
The default is 1.

.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBnormco\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
Print out less output.  This is the default.

.IP \fBVERBOSE\fP
Print out more output.
