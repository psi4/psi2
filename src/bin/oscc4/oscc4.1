.SH NAME
oscc4 \- compute the coupled cluster energy and wavefunction

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B oscc4
is used to compute the coupled cluster energy and wavefunction for
atoms and molecules with a high spin open shell reference state.
Energies for
CCD, CCSD, and CCSD(T) wavefunctions can be computed.
.B oscc4
is intended for use for very large molecules for which the memory requirement
for
.B oscc
is too large.  This program requires more I/O than
.B oscc
and should be avoided, if possible.  Also note that the SCF wavefuntion
must be obtained with the
.B scfrg
program, which writes some special information to
.pN FILE79 .

.LP
If a closed shell reference wavefunction is desired, then either the
.B cceg
or the
.B lcceg
program must be used.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B oscc4
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B OSCC4
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
A character string to be included in the output.  This string is not
used by the program.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The point group of the molecule as is described in the \fBinput\fP program
manual pages.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The type of correlation energy calculation.  This must be one of
.B CCSD
(coupled cluster with single and double excitations from the reference),
.B CCD
(coupled cluster with double excitations),
and
.B CCSD_T
(CCSD(T)).
Also supported
for debugging purposes are the values
.B CC_CISD
and
.BR CC_BOTH .
There is no default.

.IP "\fBDERTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This must be set to
.B NONE
or
.BR FIRST .
If coupled cluster gradients are desired then this parameter must
be set to
.BR FIRST .
The default is
.BR NONE .

.IP "\fBFROZEN_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation from which there will be no excitations.
The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
The default is the zero vector.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation into which there will be no excitations.
The default is the zero vector.

.IP "\fBNCSF =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of cluster coefficients to print out. The
default is 20.

.IP "\fBMAXITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum number of iterations. The default is 50
for \fBDERTYPE = NONE\fP and 60 for \fBDERTYPE = FIRST\fP.

.IP "\fBCONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The convergence criterion is 10**(\-\fIinteger\fP).  The default is 7
for \fBDERTYPE = NONE\fP and 10 for \fBDERTYPE = FIRST\fP.

.IP "\fBRESTART =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The calculation will restart from the old wavefunction
if \fIboolean\fP is true.  Possible values
for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is false.

.IP "\fBT_RESTART =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The calculation will restart a calculation including triples
excitations in the middle of an iteration
if \fIboolean\fP is true.  Possible values
for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is false.

.LP
There are also parameters for controlling DIIS, however, these
these are unneccessary for the normal use of Psi.

.LP
The occupancies of the orbitals in the reference is not read from
the input.  The 
.B oscc4
program obtaines this information from 
.pN FILE30 .

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
This is a sample input for a CCSD calculation in
.if n C2V
.if t C\s-1\d2v\u\s0
symmetry
with the lowest energy totally symmetric orbital frozen:

.DS
  default: (
    label = "C2V test case -- one frozen core orbital"
    symmetry = c2v
    wfn = ccsd
    frozen_docc = (1 0 0 0)
    frozen_uocc = (0 0 0 0)
    )
.DE

.LP
It will be almost never be necessary to include more input parameters than
are shown in the above example.

.LP
An example of a large calculation with
restart and a small tolerance for error in the wavefunction:

.DS
  default: (
    label = "C2V test case -- three frozen core orbitals"
    symmetry = c2v
    wfn = ccsd
    dertype = none
    frozen_docc = (2 0 1 0)
    frozen_uocc = (0 0 0 0)
    )

  oscc4: (
    memory = (24.0 MB)
    restart = yes
    convergence = 12
    )
.DE
