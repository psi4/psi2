.SH NAME
intder \- general curvilinear transformations

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B intder
performs general curvilinear transformations among higher
order derivatives (Cartesian <---> internal) and may be used to
calculate vibrational frequency analyses in either internal or
Cartesian coordinates.  The internal coordinates used may be either
simple coordinates or symmetrized combinations.

.LP
It is not necessary to use all 3N-6 internal coordinates when
doing the transformations, but it is wise to transform
complete symmetry blocks (i.e. work out how many normal modes
there are of a particular symmetry and then you need to have
the same number of non-redundant symmetry internal
coordinates).

.LP
.B intder
will generate a file called
.FCONST
which contains internal coordinate force constants in the format
required by 
the
.B bmat
program.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The input for this program is read from the file
.pN INPUT .
The
.B intder
program reads the definition of internal coordinates from the
.B INTCO
section of the input, and then
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B INTDER
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
The following keywords are valid:


.IP "\fBDERLVL =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the highest order of derivative to be transformed.  It can have
a value from 1 to 4.  The default is 2.

.IP "\fBTRANS_1DER =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then transform first derivatives.  The default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBIPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is a four digit number which will be explained below.  The default is
3000.

.IP "\fBTRANS_TYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies what type of transformation to perform.  If equal to
C_TO_I Cartesian derivatives are transformed to internal coordinate
derivatives.  If equal to I_TO_C then internal coordinate derivatives are
transformed to Cartesian derivatives.  I_TO_C_R is the same as I_TO_C 
except the internal coordinate derivatives are read from the file
.pN IDER
which is produced by the
.B intdif
program.
The default is C_TO_I.

.IP "\fBDUMMY_ATOMS =\fP \fIreal_array\fP"
This array specifies
the Cartesian coordinates of a dummy atom for linear bends (LIN2).
The \fIreal_array\fP is a vector of coordinates of each dummy atom.
Each element of this vector is another vector in the
form \fB(\fP\fIx\fP \fIy\fP \fIz\fP\fB)\fP.
The numbering for the dummy atoms begins at NA+1 (NA = number of atoms).

.IP "\fBREAD_GEOM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then the geometry is read from the top of the
.pN GEOM
file.  Otherwise, the last geometry in
.pN FILE11
is used (unless MULTI is greater than 0).  The default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBFREQ_ANAL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This option specifies what type of frequency analysis to perform. The options
are:
.  iV            "= NONE"    "no frequency analysis performed"
.  iV            "= INT_CO"  "perform a frequency analysis in internal coordinates"
.  iV            "= CART_CO" "perform a frequency analysis in Cartesian"
.    __                   "coordinates"
.  iV            "= BOTH"    "do frequency analysis in both internal and Cartesian coordinates"
.  iV            "= NONE_R"  "the same as = NONE  except that the force constants"
.    __                   "are input from the"
.    __                   "Q_F_CONSTS vector"
.  iV            "= INT_CO_T"  "perform a frequency analysis in internal coordinates but without transforming any derivatives"
.  iV            "= CART_CO_T"  "perform a frequency analysis in Cartesian coordinates but without transforming any derivatives"
.  iV            "= BOTH_T"  "perform a frequency analysis in internal coordinates and Cartesian coordinates but without transforming any derivatives"
.iL
The default is INT_CO.

.IP "\fBIRINT_T =\fP \fIstring\fP"
If = NONE, then no IR intensities are computed.  If = DO then internal 
coordinate dipole moment derivatives are read in from
.pN FILE18 
and IR intensities are computed.  Setting IRINT_T = DO_R does the same as
DO except that internal coordinate dipole moment derivatives are read
from the INT_DIPDER vector. The default is NONE.

.IP "\fBTRANS_DIPDER =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true then dipole moment derivatives are transformed.
Masses are read in later so that the
transformation is performed according to the
Eckart conditions.
The dipole derivatives are read from
.pN FILE17
or
.pN FILE18
(see below for a description of
the input required).
(also set DERLVL = 1 and TRANS_TYPE = C_TO_I or I_TO_C)
(TRANS_DIPDER = TRUE assigns TRANS_1DER = TRUE)
It is not possible to transform dipole moment
derivatives at the same time as energy derivatives.
If TRANS_DIPDER = TRUE, FREQ_ANAL and IRINT_T should be NONE.     \" 12-6-91 rbr ;
.   \"  NONE above was FALSE ; but variables are string type not boolean --- JRT
The default is FALSE.

.IP "\fBSTOP =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true
stop after forming the SR(I,J),X(M,N),SR(I,J,K),
and Y(M,N,P) matrices (as governed by DERLVL and TRANS_1DER).
(no auxiliary files are required (unless READ_GEOM = TRUE)).
The default is FALSE.


.IP "\fBMULTI =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This option specifies the number of geometries to read from
.pN FILE11 .
If it is = 0, the last geometry in 
.pN FILE11
is used.  If = n, then n geometries are read from
.pN FILE11
from the top down.  The default is 0.


.IP "\fBMASSES =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
Atomic masses are needed if FREQ_ANAL is not NONE or TRANS_DIPDER is TRUE.
The MASSES vector is a vector of length (# of atoms).
Defaults to standard atomic masses.


.IP "\fBQ_F_CONSTS =\fP \fIreal_matrix\fP"
This matrix must be present if FREQ_ANAL = NONE_R.
Its dimension is NSX by NSX, where NSX = the number of symmetrized
internal coordinates, or the number of simple internal coordinates if
no symmetrized internal coordinates are given.

.IP "\fBINT_DIPDER =\fP \fIreal_matrix\fP"
This matrix must be present if IRINT_T = DO_R.
It is made up of NSX vectors of length 3 and contains 
internal (symmetry) coordinate dipole moment derivatives (x, y, z) in units of
Debye/Angstrom or Debye/radian.
NSX is as defined for Q_F_CONSTS.

.IP "\fBNTEST =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Numerical testing of derivatives of the internal coodinates
with respect to the Cartesian coordinates is useful for
debugging new types of coordinates added to the program.
.  iV            "= \00"    "no test"
.  iV            "= \01"    "numerically test and check the analytic"
.    __                   "SR(I,J) and X(M,N) matrices"
.  iV            "= -1"    "form the SR(I,J) and X(M,N) matrices"
.    __                   "numerically and use these numerically"
.    __                   "computed matrices in the transformation of"
.    __                   "derivatives"
.  iV            "= \02"    "numerically test and check the analytic"
.    __                   "SR(I,J,K) and X(M,N,P) matrices"
.  iV            "= -2"    "form the SR(I,J,K) and X(M,N,P) matrices"
.    __                   "numerically and use these numerically computed"
.    __                   "matrices in the transformation of derivatives"
.iL
The default is 0.

.\" ---------------------------------------- Uncommonly used input here:
.LP
There are also a couple of less commonly used input parameters.
If you do not understand what the following options mean, then
make sure that they do not appear in your input.  The defaults will
work in the overwhelming majority of cases.
These are specified with the following keywords:

.IP "\fBNVIB =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The number of vibrational degrees of freedom.  This is used in the
calculation of the zero-point vibrational energy.  NVIB defaults to
3N-5 where N is the number of atoms.  This is normally ok, since
any mode whose frequency is below ZPVE_LIM (see below) will not be included.

.IP "\fBZPVE_LIM =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The threshold to include frequencies in the calculation of the zero-point
vibrational energy is set to \fIinteger\fP.  The default is 20.


.IP
If TRANS_TYPE = I_TO_C_R the unique internal coordinate derivatives
which are non-zero are read in from the 
.pN IDER
file which is produced by the
.B intdif
program.
Use units consistent with the energy in
mdyne*Angstrom.  This line takes one or more of several forms
given in a, b, c, and d.
