.SH NAME
gradtol \- determines whether an optimization step has converged

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B gradtol
determines whether a geometry optimization step has converged 
using several criterion including energy change, gradient size, and
geometry change.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B gradtol
program searches
through the default keyword path (first
.B GRADTOL
and then
.BR DEFAULT ).
The geometry point evaluated is the one at the bottom of file11.dat.
The following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBMINIMUM =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If the optimization is a minimum search then the energy should decrease
every step.  Not so for a transition state search.
Options are 
.B true,
.B false,
.B 1,
or
.B 0.
The default is true.

.IP "\fBNO_INT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If 
.B true 
then the program will only do Cartesian convergence analysis.  If
.B false, 
the program will also do convergence analysis in internal coordinates.
The default is true since the program cannot currently do internal
coordinates.

.IP "\fBFIRST_RUN =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If 
.B true 
then the program will assume there is only one gradient point (the
last one in file11.dat) and make no comparisons to the previous 
gradient point.  If
.B false, 
the program will make comparisons to the previous geometry step.
The default is false if more than one gradient point exists in file11.dat.

.SH CONVERGENCE CRITERION
The following convergence criterion are recognized by \fBgradtol\fP.
In all cases, the criterion used by the program is 10**-\fIinteger\fP.
In general, the defaults should be adequate, and should not be overridden
unless you are the type of egotist who thinks he knows what he is doing.
The exceptions may be \fBRMS_GRAD_CART\fP and \fBRMS_GRAD_INT\fP.
Note that in some cases the defaults depend on other criterion, and that
changing one value could change several.

.IP "\fBMAX_NRG =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum allowable energy change between geometry points to be considered
converged.  Default value is 10.

.IP "\fBRMS_GRAD_INT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The largest allowable root-mean-squared internal coordinate gradient for a
geometry point to be considered to be converged.
Default value is 6.

.IP "\fBRMS_GRAD_CART =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The largest allowable root-mean-squared Cartesian coordinate gradient for a
geometry point to be considered to be converged.
Default value is 6.

.IP "\fBMAX_GRAD_INT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum allowable internal coordinate gradient for a
geometry point to be considered to be converged.
This criterion defaults to 1.5 times the associated rms criterion.

.IP "\fBMAX_GRAD_CART =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum allowable Cartesian coordinate gradient for a
geometry point to be considered to be converged.
This criterion defaults to 1.5 times the associated rms criterion.

.IP "\fBRMS_DISP_CART =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The largest allowable root-mean-squared Cartesian coordinate change between 
geometry points to be considered to be converged.
This criterion defaults to 4.0 times the associated gradient criterion.

.IP "\fBMAX_DISP_CART =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The maximum allowable Cartesian coordinate change between 
geometry points to be considered to be converged.
This criterion defaults to 1.5 times the associated rms criterion.

.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBgradtol\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
This should be \fBON\fP to indicate that minimal printing is
desired.  The default is \fBON\fP.

.IP \fBVERBOSE\fP
Print out more output than is typically necessary this inculdes the value
of internal coordinates.  Defaults to
OFF.  If VERBOSE is ON, then BRIEF is reset to OFF.

.IP \fBDEBUG\fP
Print out far more information than anyone could possibly want.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
To override the 
.B BRIEF
printing option and get more output, input.dat should include

.DS
  gradtol: (
    print = ((ON VERBOSE)(OFF BRIEF DEBUG))
    )
.DE
