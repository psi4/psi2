.SH NAME
contour3d \- draws 3-dimension contour plots for orbitals (and total density).

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B contour3d
draws 3-dimension contour plots for orbitals and total density.
The user can chose from atomic orbitals, canonical molecular orbitals,
localized molecular orbitals, and total electron density.
The output file,
.pN CONTOUR ,
is in the PostScript language.  It can be printed on any
PostScript printer or displayed on a workstation with a PostScript
previewer.

The \fBcontour\fP program requires the basis set from
.pN FILE30 .

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B contour3d
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B CONTOUR3D
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBORBTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This gives the type of orbital to be plotted.
If it is \fBLMO\fP, then a localized molecular orbital will be
retrieved from the
.pN LMO
file.
If it is \fBCMO\fP, then a canonical molecular orbital
will be retrieved from the
.pN CMO
file.
If it is \fBAO\fP, then an atomic orbital will be plotted.
If it is \fBDENS\fP, a density plot is done, using the orbitals
from the
.pN CMO
file.  The latter choice only works
for closed shell molecules.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBORBNUM =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the number of the orbital to be plotted.  Consult
the
.pN CMO
and
.pN LMO
files to get the ordering of the orbitals.
If 
.B ORBTYPE
=
.B DENS
, 
.B ORBNUM
= the number of doubly-occupied orbitals (closed-shell case only).  Otherwise,
there is no default.

.IP "\fBPLANE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This is the plane for which the contour is generated.  It consists
of two letters, each of which must be \fBX\fP, \fBY\fP, or \fBZ\fP.
The first letter indicates which molecular axis becomes the page's
x axis.  The second indicates which molecular axis becomes the
page's y axis.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This gives a label to be included in the PostScript image.  The
default is a blank line.

.IP "\fBX0 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the minimum value for the page's x axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the minimum x value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) minus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBX1 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the maximum value for the page's x axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the maximum x value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) plus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBY0 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the minimum value for the page's y axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the minimum y value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) minus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBY1 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the maximum value for the page's y axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the maximum y value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) plus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBZ0 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the minimum value for the page's z axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the minimum z value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) minus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBZ1 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the maximum value for the page's z axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the maximum y value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) plus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBZD =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the difference of the z values adjacent contours.
The default is 0.2 bohr.

.IP "\fBPHI =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the angle (in degrees) by which the figure rotated around the 
page's x axis counterclockwise.  The acceptable value is from -90.0 to
90.0 degrees.  The default is 10 degrees.

.IP "\fBTHETA =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the angle (in degrees) by which the figure rotated around the 
page's y axis clockwise.  The acceptable value is from -90.0 to
90.0 degrees.  The default is 20 degrees.

.IP "\fBCOLOR =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If this is set to \fBYES\fP, then output for a PostScript device which
can use color is generated.  The default is \fBNO\fP.

.IP "\fBROTATE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If this is set to \fBYES\fP, then PostScript output will be rotated.
If this is set to \fBNO\fP, then PostScript output will not be rotated.
If \fBROTATE\fP is not given, then the \fBcontour\fP program will
try to maximize the size of the plot by choosing the appropriate orientation.

.IP "\fBGRIDSIZE =\fP \fIreal\fP"
The size of the grid use to compute the values of an orbital, in Bohr.
The default is the maximum of \fBX1\fP\-\fBX0\fP and \fBY1\fP\-\fBY0\fP
divided by 120.  If you want smoother looking contours, then chose a
smaller value for \fBGRIDSIZE\fP.

.IP "\fBCONTOURVAL =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the value for the contour line. The default is 1.0.

.IP "\fBSPLINE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If set to \fByes\fP, then the contour lines will become smoother.
However, its effect is limited. The default is no.

.IP "\fBATOM_LABEL =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If set to \fByes\fP, then the atomic symbols in bold font, instead of dots, will
be shown on the positions of atoms in the plot.  The default is no.

.IP "\fBSHOW_AXIS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If set to \fByes\fP, then the axes x, y, and z with the lengths of 2 bohr will 
be shown on the plot.  This is good for the testing run.  The default is no.

.IP "\fBDASH_LINE\fP \fIinteger\fP" 
Determines the size of the dashed lines in the orbital plots.  A value of
1 is has the smallest spacing, whereas a value of 5 has the largest spacings.
The default value is 2.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBcontour3d\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
This should be \fBON\fP to indicate that minimal printing is
desired.  The default is \fBON\fP.

.LP
In practice, very little input is needed to get started.
This example plots the
fourth canonical molecular orbital in water:

.DS
  contour3d: (
   label = "H2O DZ"
   plane = yz
   phi = 15.0
   theta = 30.0
   orbtype = cmo
   orbnum = 4
   x0 = -2.0
   x1 = +2.0
   y0 = -2.0
   y1 = +2.5
   z0 = -1.5
   z1 =  2.0
   zd =  0.10
   gridsize = 0.10
   contourval = 0.12
   atom_label = yes
   show_axis = no
   spline = no
   print = ((off brief))
   dash_line = 2
   )

.LP
If you want to display the PostScript file on a color workstation,
then the following input could be added to the above (but it is not required
for a color workstation):

.DS
  contour: color = yes
.DE

.LP
As you fine tune your plot, you will probably eventually override most
of the defaults.

.SH BUGS
.LP
Dimensions of arrays in the \fBcontour3d\fP program are set at compile
time and no double checking is done to make sure that memory is not
being overwritten.  This needs to be fixed, but, for now, if a large
molecule gives strange results, this could be the reason.

.LP
Sometimes, if the contour surface has a hole in it, such as donut-shape, 
you may not see anything through the hole.  If this happens, try editing the
.pN CONTOUR
file.
