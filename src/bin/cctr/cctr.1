.SH NAME
cctr \- transforms integrals from the SO to MO basis

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B cctr
is used to transform the integrals from the SO to the MO basis
for their subsequent use in coupled cluster calculations.

.pN INPUT
.eL "FILES REQUIRED"

.pN OUTPUT
.eL "FILES UPDATED"

.pN CHECK
.pN FILE6
.eL "FILES GENERATED"

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B cctr
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B CCTR
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The point group of the molecule as is described in the \fBinput\fP program
manual pages.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBDELETE34 =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The program will delete the SO basis two electron integrals in
.pN FILE34
after the
transformation is complete if \fIboolean\fP is true.
Possible values for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is true.

.IP "\fBLARGE_CORE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
.B cctr
rarely needs more than 6 megabytes of memory, and on the rs6000s will
run very slowly if more than 8 mb of core has been specified with MEMORY.
Thus, by default, 
.B cctr
will use less than 8mb of core, regardless of what is specified with the
MEMORY keyword.  If more memory is needed, then set LARGE_CORE to TRUE.
The default is false.


.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Usually, no extra input need be provided.  However, if for some reason
the two electron integrals should be kept after
.B cctr
completes, then the following input can be given: 

.DS
  default: (
    symmetry = c2v
    )

  cctr: (
    delete34 = no
    )
.DE
