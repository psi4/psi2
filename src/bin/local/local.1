.SH NAME
local \- localizes molecular orbitals

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B local
localizes the molecular orbitals
using the algorithm of Pipek and Mezey.  After execution,
the files
.pN CMO
and
.pN LMO
will contain the canonical molecular orbitals (as found
in
.pN FILE30 )
and the localized
molecular orbitals, respectively, in terms of the
atomic orbitals.
The
.pN CMO
file contains all of the orbitals, but the
.pN LMO
file only contains the doubly occupied orbitals.
These files can then be
used by the \fBcontour\fP program to localize the orbitals.

The \fBlocal\fP program needs the molecular orbital and basis set
information from
.pN FILE30 .

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B local
program requires no special input.  However, the input options
which apply to all programs apply to the \fBlocal\fP program.
For this input, the default keyword path (first
.B LOCAL
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
is searched.

.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBlocal\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
This should be \fBON\fP to indicate that minimal printing is
desired.  The default is \fBON\fP.

.SH BUGS
Dimensions of arrays in the \fBlocalf\fP program are set at compile
time and no double checking is done to make sure that memory is not
being overwritten.  This needs to be fixed, but, for now, if a large
molecule gives strange results, this could be the reason.
