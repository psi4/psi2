.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B deriv
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B DERIV
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:


.IP "\fBDERTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies the order of derivative that is to eventually be done.
It is used by the
.B scf
program to determine if certain files are to be written and it is
also used to determine the default convergence of the wavefunction.
The default is
.BR FIRST .

.IP "\fBOPENTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies the state desired.  It can be one of
.B NONE
(for a closed shell singlet),
.B SINGLET
(for an open shell singlet with two singly occupied orbitals of
different irreducible representations),
.B HIGHSPIN
(for any high spin open shell system),
.B TWOCON
(for a two configuration singlet).
The default is
.BR NONE .

.IP "\fBIPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is a print option.
The default is 0.

.IP "\fBTCSCF_GR =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This option forces the program to use the general-restricted Hartree-Fock
form of the equations for two-configuration SCF wavefunctions, rather than the
hardwired alpha and beta coefficients for the TCSCF case.  The default
is false.  Setting this option to true allows the evaluation of
analytic derivatives for the second root of a TCSCF.  This keyword 
should have no effect for the lowest root of a TCSCF.
.LP
The are also keywords provided for compatability.
These are subject to
change.
If they are to be
used, then Psi maintenance personnel should be consulted first.
The options are
.BR RAMAN ,
.BR NOSYM ,
.BR AFOCK ,
.BR DFOCK ,
and
.BR DERINT .

.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBderiv\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
Only print out total first derivatives.  Defaults to ON.

.IP \fBVERBOSE\fP
Print out components of first and second derivatives.  Defaults to
OFF.  If VERBOSE is ON, then BRIEF is reset to OFF.

.IP \fBDEBUG\fP
Print out far more information than you could possibly want.
