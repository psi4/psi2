.TH contour 1 "18 June, 1991" "\*(]W" "\*(]D"
.SH NAME
contour \- draws contour plots for orbitals

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B contour
draws contour plots for orbitals.
The user can chose from atomic orbitals, canonical molecular orbitals,
or localized molecular orbitals.
The output file,
.pN CONTOUR ,
is in the PostScript language.  It can be printed on any
PostScript printer or displayed on a workstation with a PostScript
previewer.

The \fBcontour\fP program requires the basis set from
.pN FILE30 .

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B contour
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B CONTOUR
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBORBTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This gives the type of orbital to be plotted.
If it is \fBLMO\fP, then a localized molecular orbital will be
retrieved from the
.pN LMO
file.
If it is \fBCMO\fP, then a canonical molecular orbital
will be retrieved from the
.pN CMO
file.
If it is \fBAO\fP, then an atomic orbital will be plotted.
If it is \fBDENS\fP, a density plot is done, using the orbitals
from the
.pN CMO
file.  The latter choice only works
for closed shell molecules.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBORBNUM =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the number of the orbital to be plotted.  Consult
the
.pN CMO
and
.pN LMO
files to get the ordering of the orbitals.
If 
.B ORBTYPE
=
.B DENS
, 
.B ORBNUM
= the number of doubly-occupied orbitals (closed-shell case only).  Otherwise,
there is no default.

.IP "\fBPLANE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This is the plane for which the contour is generated.  It consists
of two letters, each of which must be \fBX\fP, \fBY\fP, or \fBZ\fP.
The first letter indicates which molecular axis becomes the page's
y axis.  The second indicates which molecular axis becomes the
page's x axis.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This gives a label to be included in the PostScript image.  The
default is a blank line.

.IP "\fBX0 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the minimum value for the page's x axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the minimum x value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) minus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBX1 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the maximum value for the page's x axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the maximum x value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) plus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBY0 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the minimum value for the page's y axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the minimum y value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) minus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBY1 =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the maximum value for the page's y axis.  The units are
Bohr.  The default is the maximum y value for a nuclear
center (after its axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword) plus 1.5 Bohr.

.IP "\fBZ =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the value for the z axis
(after the molecular axis
system is converted into the page's axis system using the \fBPLANE\fP
keyword).  The default is 0.0.

.IP "\fBCOLOR =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If this is set to \fBYES\fP, then output for a PostScript device which
can use color is generated.  The default is \fBNO\fP.

.IP "\fBROTATE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If this is set to \fBYES\fP, then PostScript output will be rotated.
If this is set to \fBNO\fP, then PostScript output will not be rotated.
If \fBROTATE\fP is not given, then the \fBcontour\fP program will
try to maximize the size of the plot by choosing the appropriate orientation.

.IP "\fBGRIDSIZE =\fP \fIreal\fP"
The size of the grid use to compute the values of an orbital, in Bohr.
The default is the maximum of \fBX1\fP\-\fBX0\fP and \fBY1\fP\-\fBY0\fP
divided by 120.  If you want smoother looking contours, then chose a
smaller value for \fBGRIDSIZE\fP.

.IP "\fBCONTOURMAX =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the maximum value of a contour line. The default is 1.0.

.IP "\fBCONTOURMIN =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the minimum value of a contour line. The default is -1.0.

.IP "\fBCONTOURSTEP =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is the difference of the values adjacent contours, in Bohr.
The default is 0.1.

.IP "\fBSPLINE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If set to \fByes\fP, then the contour lines will become smoother.
However, it's effect is limited.

.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBcontour\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
This should be \fBON\fP to indicate that minimal printing is
desired.  The default is \fBON\fP.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
In practice, very little input is needed to get started.
This example plots the
fourth localized molecular orbital in water:

.DS
  contour: (
    label = "H2O DZ"
    orbtype = lmo
    orbnum = 4
    plane = xy
    )
.DE

.LP
If you want to display the PostScript file on a color workstation,
then the following input could be added to the above (but it is not required
for a color workstation):

.DS
  contour: color = yes
.DE

.LP
As you fine tune your plot, you will probably eventually override most
of the defaults.

.SH BUGS
.LP
Dimensions of arrays in the \fBcontour\fP program are set at compile
time and no double checking is done to make sure that memory is not
being overwritten.  This needs to be fixed, but, for now, if a large
molecule gives strange results, this could be the reason.

.LP
Sometimes, when node contours intersect each other, the lines may have defects.
If this is unacceptable, then try editing the
.pN CONTOUR
file.
