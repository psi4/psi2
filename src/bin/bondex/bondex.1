.SH NAME
bondex \- compute bond orders and valencies

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B bondex
calculates bond orders and valencies (both Mulliken and
Lowdin).  The program is limited to 200 basis functions and 112
atoms.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B bondex
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B BONDEX
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This is the type of wavefunction which is ultimately desired.
The default is
.B SCF .

.IP "\fBF_OR_G =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Set to TRUE if f and g functions are present.  The default is TRUE.

.IP "\fBIPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
A printing flag.  The default is 0.

.LP
If using WFN = CI, \fBbondex\fP would normally be run after the
program \fBbacktr\fP.  Alternatively, it is possible to calculate
just the CI energy and then run \fBmakepk\fP (or \fBmaster\fP), 
\fBonepdm\fP (with the option WRTOPDM = TRUE) and \fBbondex\fP.
