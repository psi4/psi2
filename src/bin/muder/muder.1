.SH NAME
muder \- determines dipole moment first derivatives

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B muder
determines dipole moment first derivatives in
internal coordinates.  It also updates file12.dat to the format
of file12a.dat.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B muder
program searches for the 
.B INTCO
section of the input,
and then through the default keyword path (first
.B MUDER
and then
.BR DEFAULT ).
The reference geometry from which the displaced geometries were made should
appear at the tops of file11.dat, file12.dat and file28.dat.  The 
following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The type of wavefunction for which finite displacements have been run.
Options are 
.B SCF,
.B CI,
.B CCSD
or
.B CCSD_T.
Dipole moment components are read from
.pN FILE11 ,
if wfn is set equal to ci.  If wfn is equal to ccsd or ccsd_t then the
dipole moment components are read from
.pN file28.dat. 
If wfn is equal to scf then no dipole moment components are read.

.IP "\fBN_INTCO =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
.B muder
first searches through
.pN INPUT
for the
.B INTCO
section, and counts the number of elements in the
.B SYMM
and
.B ASYMM
vectors (see intco(2) for more information on
.B INTCO
).
It is possible, however, to override this and specify the number of
internal coordinates you wish to work with.  This is not recommended and
should only be done if you are an experienced user.

.IP "\fBDIP_PAR =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The DIP_PAR array gives information concerning internal coordinates for which
only positive displacements were needed.
The format is as follows:

.DS
dip_par = (
  (ni (px py pz))
   "   "  "  "
   "   "  "  "
  )
.DE

where ni is a coordinate for which only a positive displacement is given,
and 
px, py and pz specify the parity (+1 or -1) of the x, y and z components
of the dipole moment under the symmetry
operation which generates the -ni displacement from the +ni displacement,
The number of vectors in the DIP_PAR array should be equal
to the number of internal coordinates for which only positive displacements
are needed.
DIP_PAR defaults to the zero vector.


.SH PRINT CONTROL
The following print control options are recognized by \fBmuder\fP:

.IP \fBBRIEF\fP
This should be \fBON\fP to indicate that minimal printing is
desired.  The default is \fBON\fP.

.IP \fBVERBOSE\fP
Print out more output than is typically necessary.  Defaults to
OFF.  If VERBOSE is ON, then BRIEF is reset to OFF.

.IP \fBDEBUG\fP
Print out far more information than anyone could possibly want.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
To override the 
.B BRIEF
printing option and get more output, input.dat should include

.DS
  muder: (
    print = ((ON VERBOSE)(OFF BRIEF DEBUG))
    )
.DE
