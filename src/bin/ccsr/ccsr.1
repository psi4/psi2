.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B ccsr
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B CCSR
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The point group of the molecule as is described in the \fBinput\fP program
manual pages.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBLARGE_CORE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
.B ccsr
rarely needs more than 6 megabytes of memory, and on the rs6000s will
run very slowly if more than 8 mb of core has been specified with MEMORY.
Thus, by default, 
.B ccsr
will use less than 8mb of core, regardless of what is specified with the
MEMORY keyword.  If more memory is needed, then set LARGE_CORE to TRUE.
The default is false.
