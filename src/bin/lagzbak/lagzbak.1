.SH NAME
lagzbak \- lagrangian, z-cphf and 2pdm back transformation

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B lagzbak
is used to transform the coupled cluster one- and two pdm to scf ordering,
calculate the coupled cluster lagrangian, and transform the two pdm to
the SO basis.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B lagzbak
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B LAGZBAK
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
A character string to be included in the output.  This string is not
used by the program.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBSYMMETRY =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The point group of the molecule as is described in the \fBinput\fP program
manual pages.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
The type of correlation energy calculation.  This must be one of
.B CCSD
(coupled cluster with single and double excitations from the reference),
.B CCD
(coupled cluster with double excitations),
.B CCSDT1
(CCSDT-1),
and
.B CCSD_T
(CCSD(T)).
The CCSDT-1 method is not recommended.  The CCSD(T) method should
be used if the effects of triples are desired.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBDERTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This must be set to
.B FIRST
or the program will abort.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_DOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which should not excited from.  The default is the
zero vector.

.IP "\fBFROZEN_UOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
The number of unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible
representation which should not excited into.  The default is the
zero vector.

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
This is a sample input for a CCSD calculation in
.if n C2V
.if t C\s-1\d2v\u\s0
symmetry
with the lowest energy totally symmetric orbital frozen:

.DS
  default: (
    label = "C2V test case -- one frozen core orbital"
    wfn = ccsd
    dertype = first
    frozen_docc = (1 0 0 0)
    frozen_uocc = (0 0 0 0)
    )
.DE

.LP
It will be almost never be necessary to include more input parameters than
are shown in the above example.  Moreover, once the input for the
.B cceg
program has been set up, it is usually unnecessary to provide any more
input for the
.B lagzbak
program.
