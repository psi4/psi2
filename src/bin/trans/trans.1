.SH NAME
trans \- transforms integrals from SO to MO basis

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B trans
carries out the transformation of integrals from the symmetry
adapted atomic orbital basis to the molecular orbital basis
for use in
.B gugaci
calculations.

.SH INPUT REQUIRED
.LP
The
.B trans
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B TRANS
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This is the type of wavefunction which is ultimately desired.
The default is
.BR CI .

.IP "\fBDELETE34 =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The program will delete the SO basis two electron integrals in
.pN FILE34
after the
transformation is complete if \fIboolean\fP is true.
Possible values for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is true unless the
.BR WFN
is CASSCF, in which case the default must be false.

.IP "\fBLARGE_CORE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
.B trans
rarely needs more than 6 megabytes of memory, and on the rs6000s will
run very slowly if more than 8 mb of core has been specified with MEMORY.
Thus, by default, 
.B trans
will use less than 8mb of core, regardless of what is specified with the
MEMORY keyword.  If more memory is needed, then set LARGE_CORE to TRUE.
The default is false.

.LP
Note:  If
.b trans
aborts with a message "BKTSZ TOO SMALL", then change the BLOCKSIZE
parameter (see drt(1) for more information).

.SH EXAMPLE
.LP
Usually, no input need be provided.  However, if for some reason
the two electron integrals should be kept after
.B trans
completes, then the following input can be given:

.DS
  trans: (
    delete34 = no
    )
.DE

.IP "\fint_accuracy =\fP \finteger\fP"
Sets the integral accuracy threshold to 10^-X.  Default value is 12 which
sets the integral threshold to 10^-12.

.IP "\fvec_accuracy =\fP \finteger\fP"
Sets the SCF vector accuracy threshold to 10^-X.  Default value is 12 which
sets the integral threshold to 10^-12.
