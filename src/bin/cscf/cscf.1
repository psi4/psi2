.SH NAME
cscf \- solves the Hartree-Fock equations

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The program
.B cscf
carries out the iterative procedure to solve the
Hartree-Fock equations.

.LP
This program is restricted to
.if n D2h
.if t D\s-2\d2h\u\s0
symmetry and its subgroups
and the orbital occupations are required to be integers.
Thus, certain pure
angular momentum states derived from partial occupation of degenerate
orbitals cannot be obtained with the present codes.  For example, the
.if n 2PIu (doublet PI u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0\(*P\s-2\du\u\s0
state of linear O-N-O derived from the lowest energy
linear
.if n (pi u)1
.if t \(*p\s-2\d\zu\u\u1\d\s0
configuration may only be computed as the
.if n 2B2u (doublet B2u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0B\s-2\d2u\u\s0
or
.if n 2B3u (doublet B 3u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0B\s-2\d3u\u\s0
component of the
.if n 2PIu (doublet PI u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0\(*P\s-2\du\u\s0
state,
and the resulting spatial wavefunction will not have
.if n PI
.if t \(*P
symmetry.  In a
certain sense, however, this is desirable, as the energy will be a
continuous function of the bending angle.  Calculating the energy of
bent configurations as
.if n 2B2u (doublet B 2u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0B\s-2\d2u\u\s0
or
.if n 2B3u (doublet B 3u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0B\s-2\d3u\u\s0
and doing a pure
.if n 2PIu (doublet PI u)
.if t \s-2\u2\d\s0\(*P\s-2\du\u\s0
state at linear geometries results in a pronounced discontinuity.

.LP
For the most part, triplet states resulting from double occupation
of a doubly degenerate orbital, such as the
.if n 3A2 (triplet A 2)
.if t \s-2\u3\d\s0A\s-2\d2\u\s0
state resulting from the
.if n (e')2
.if t e\(fm\s-2\u2\d\s0
or
.if n (e")2
.if t e\(fm\(fm\s-2\u2\d\s0
configurations in
.if n D3h
.if t D\s-2\d3h\u\s0
symmetry, or
the
.if n 3SIGMAg (triplet SIGMA g)
.if t \s-2\u3\d\s0\(*S\s-2\dg\u\s0
state of a
.if n (pi g)2
.if t \(*p\s-2\d\zg\u\u2\d\s0
or
.if n (pi u)2
.if t \(*p\s-2\d\zu\u\u2\d\s0
configuration in
.if n Dinfh (D infinity h)
.if t D\s-2\d\(ifh\u\s0
symmetry, will have the proper spatial symetry.
The singlet states resulting from these same electronic configurations
are inherently multiconfiguration and, as such, are not well represented
by single configuration wavefunctions.

.SH CONVERGING \fBCSCF\fP
.LP
For difficult open shell cases, it is recommended
that an appropriate closed shell calculation be run first (add or
remove an extra electron) and that this SCF vector then be used as
a guess for the desired open shell wavefunction.  For
TCSCF cases, it is always wise to run a closed shell (or perhaps
the appropriate triplet) SCF first and then use this as a guess for
the TCSCF.

.LP
For open shell systems, a level shift value of
0.5 to 3.0 is recommended.  Start with a high value (2.0 - 3.0)
for the first SCF calculation and then reduce it (to 0.5 - 1.0)
for subsequent runs which use a converged SCF vector as the
starting point.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
.\" ---------------------------------------- Commonly used input here:
.LP
The
.B cscf
program
searches through the default keyword path (first
.B SCF
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
for the following keywords:

.IP "\fBLABEL =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This is a character string to be included in the output.  This string is not
used by the program.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBWFN =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This is the type of wavefunction which is ultimately desired.
The default is
.BR SCF .

.IP "\fBOPENTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies the state desired.  It can be one of
.B NONE
(for a closed shell singlet),
.B SINGLET
(for an open shell singlet with two singly occupied orbitals of
different irreducible representations),
.B HIGHSPIN
(for any high spin open shell system),
.B TWOCON
(for a two configuration singlet), or
.BR SPECIAL .
If \fBSPECIAL\fP is given, then
.if n alpha
.if t \(*a
and
.if n beta
.if t \(*b
coupling coefficients must be given with the
.B ALPHA
and
.B BETA
keywords.
The default is
.BR NONE .

.IP "\fBDOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
This gives the number of doubly occupied orbitals in each
irreducible representation.  There is no default.

.IP "\fBSOCC =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
This gives the number of singly occupied orbitals in each
irreducible representation.  If \fBOPENTYPE = NONE\fP,
then this defaults to the zero vector.  Otherwise,
there is no default.

.IP "\fBDERTYPE =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies the order of derivative that is to eventually be done.
It is used by the
.B scf
program to determine if certain files are to be written and it is
also used to determine the default convergence of the wavefunction.
The default is
.BR FIRST .

.IP "\fBMAXITER =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the maximum number of iterations.
The default is 40.

.IP "\fBCONVERGENCE =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
The convergence criterion is
.if n 10**(\-\fIinteger\fP).
.if t 10\s-2\u(\-\fIinteger\fP)\d\s0.
The default is 7
if both \fBDERTYPE = NONE\fP and \fBWFN = SCF\fP are given
and 10 otherwise.

.IP "\fBLEVELSHIFT =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This specifies the level shift. The default is 1.
.\"----------------------------------------- New Occupation Guessing Keywords
.LP
These keywords have been added to aid the user in guessing 
occupations without specifying DOCC or SOCC.  If a DOCC and SOCC are 
provided then those occupations are used by default.  If there is a 
previous scf vector stored in file30 then the occupupations stored in 
file30 are used unless GUESS_ALWAYS is used.  If neither of these are true, 
the a core hamiltonian guess is made and the occupations are determined 
from this.  These are the keywords associated with this feature.

.IP "\fBGUESS =\fP \fIstring\fP"
This specifies what method is used when guessing the occupations.
B. CORE
Use the core hamiltonian guess(default:see above)
B. HUCKEL
Use a the huckel approximation to make an initial guess at the 
occupations.  Not currently implemented so using this keyword will 
default to the core hamiltonian method.

.IP "\fBMULTP=\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies the multiplicity of the molecule.  Currently singlets, triplets 
and doublets are the only multiplicities inplemented. Default is singlet.  
It is important to note that the HIGHSPIN keyword must still be set to 
the correct value (mainly this problem is due to the possibility of 
open shell singlets) otherwise the program will give an error.

.IP "\fBCHARGE=\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Specifies the charge of the molecule. Defauly is 0.

.IP "\fBOCC_FIX=\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Should be the keyword OCC_FLUB but this keyword turns on guessing 
the occupations after every SCF iteration.  This is how ACES does it.  
This option can seriously effect convergence if the molecule is 
problematic so use this option at your own risk.  It can be helpful 
if the core hamiltonian does not provide an accurate guess, but of 
course if you know the occupations, use DOCC and SOCC.  Default is FALSE.


.\" ---------------------------------------- Uncommonly used input here:
.LP
There are also a large number of less commonly used input parameters.
If you do not understand what the following options mean, then
make sure that they do not appear in your input.  The defaults will
work in the overwhelming majority of cases.
These are specified with the following keywords:

.IP "\fBDELETE34 =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
.pN FILE34
will be erased if \fBWFN = SCF\fP and \fBDERTYPE = FIRST\fP
or \fBDERTYPE = NONE\fP.  
If you wish to keep 
.pn FILE34
then set DELETE34 = false.  The default is true.

.IP "\fBREORDER =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The molecular orbitals will be reordered if this is true, in which
case, the MOORDER parameter must be present.
The default is false.

.IP "\fBMOORDER =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
This specifies a molecular orbital reordering vector.  It will only
be used if \fBREORDER = YES\fP.  This vector contains first the
ordering for the orbitals in the first irreducible representation
and then the second and so on.  The first orbital of each
irreducible representation is numbered 1.
There is no default.

.if n .ds MM MM
.if t .ds MM n\s-2\dsocc\u\s0

.IP "\fBALPHA =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
If \fBOPENTYPE = SPECIAL\fR, then this parameter gives the
.if n alpha
.if t \(*a
coupling coefficients.  The number of elements in this vector is
\*(MM(\*(MM+1)/2, where \*(MM is the number of
irreducible representations containing singly
occupied molecular orbitals.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBBETA =\fP \fIreal_vector\fP"
If \fBOPENTYPE = SPECIAL\fR, then this parameter gives the
.if n beta
.if t \(*b
coupling coefficients.  The number of elements in this vector is
\*(MM(\*(MM+1)/2, where \*(MM is the number of
irreducible representations containing singly
occupied molecular orbitals.
There is no default.

.IP "\fBRESTART =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The calculation will restart from the old wavefunction
if \fIboolean\fP is true.  If the old wavefunction does not
exist, then the
.B scf
program will generate its own initial guess automatically.
Possible values for this parameter are
.BR TRUE ,
.BR YES ,
.BR 1 ,
.BR FALSE ,
.BR NO ,
and
.BR 0 .
The default is true.

.IP "\fBIPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This is a print option.
The default is 0.

.IP "\fMO_OUT =\fP \fTboolean\fP"
Prints out the orbitals with symmetry and occupations 
at the end of the calculation.  Default is true.
calculation
.IP "\fBROTATE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
The molecular orbitals will not be rotated if this is false.
The rotation only affects the virtual orbitals for open shell systems.
This parameter must be true for correlated gradients and it must be
false for second and higher derivatives.
The default is false if \fBWFN = SCF\fP
and true otherwise.

.IP "\fBCHECK_ROT =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Check the molecular orbital rotation described above to ensure that
no columns of the SCF eigenvector matrix are swapped by the rotation.
Has no effect if \fBROTATE = false\fP.  The default is true.

.IP "\fBDIIS =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
This determines whether diis will be used.  The default is
true.

.IP "\fBDIISSTART =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the first iteration for which DIIS will be used.
The default is 0.

.IP "\fBNDIIS =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
This gives the number of error matrices to use in the diis
procedure.  The default is 6 for closed shell, 4 for open 
shell, and 3 for tcscf.

.IP "\fBDIISDAMP =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This gives the damping factor for the diis procedure.  The 
default is 0.0 for closed shell, 0.02 for open shell, and
0.01 for tcscf.

.IP "\fBINCR =\fP \fIreal\fP"
This is used in tcscf to determine how often the ci    
coefficients are recalculated.  A small number (~0.25)  
will cause them to be recalculated nearly every scf      
iteration.  The default is 0.25.
