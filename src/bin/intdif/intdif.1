.SH INPUT FORMAT
.LP
The
.B intdif
program searches for the 
.B INTCO
section of the input,
and then through the default keyword path (first
.B INTDIF
and then
.BR DEFAULT )
The following keywords are valid:

.IP "\fBDIATOMIC =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
For the case of a diatomic molecule (or if only one coordinate is
pertinent), energy points and/or gradients are used to locate the
energy minimum and obtain force constants up to fourth order.
If DIATOMIC is true, then the POINTS vector must be given.
The default is false.

.IP "\fBGUESS_F =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
Used if DIATOMIC is true.
If GUESS_F is true and the number of POINTS given is equal to 3 or 4, then
approximate (fixed) values for the cubic and quartic force constants can be
given with the CUBE_F and QUART_F keywords.  If the number of POINTS is
3, then both CUBE_F and QUART_F can be given, while if the number of
POINTS is 4, only the QUART_F keyword is read.  The default is false.

.IP "\fBPOINTS =\fP \fIreal_array\fP"
Used if DIATOMIC is true.
The POINTS array is a vector of vectors.  Each element contains a
value for the internal coordinate (in Angstroms), and the corresponding energy
(in hartrees).  There is no default.

.IP "\fBMASSES = \fP \fIreal_array\fP"
Used if DIATOMIC is true.  The MASSES array is a vector of real numbers.
It contains only two entries correponding to the mass of each atom in the
diatomic molecule, in atomic mass units (amu's).  If this vector is
omitted, INTDIF will not return values for spectroscopic constants such as
the harmonic vibrational frequency, anharmonic constant, etc.  This vector
should be omitted when using DIATOMIC=TRUE with non-diatomic molecules
(e.g.  in the optimization of a polyatomic molecule with only one degree of
freedom).

.IP "\fBCUBE_F =\fP \fIreal\fP"
Used if DIATOMIC is true, and the number of POINTS is 3.  
Defaults to zero.  CUBE_F is used to specify a fixed value for the
cubic force constant in mdyne/Angstrom**2.

.IP "\fBQUART_F =\fP \fIreal\fP"
Used if DIATOMIC is true, and the number of POINTS is 3 or 4.  
Defaults to zero.  QUART_F is used to specify a fixed value for the
quartic force constant in mdyne/Angstrom**3.

.LP
The following options are used if DIATOMIC is false:

.IP "\fBDERLVL =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
Highest order for which analytic derivatives are available.
First  derivatives are read from
.pN FILE12A ,
second derivatives are read from
.pN FILE16A ,
and third derivatives are read from
.pN FILE21A .
For a description of the format required, see below.
Defaults to 1.

.IP "\fBN_INTCO =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
.B intdif
first searches through
.pN INPUT
for the
.B INTCO
section, and counts the number of elements in the SYMM and ASYMM
vectors (see intco(2) for more information on INTCO).
It is possible, however, to override this and specify the number of
internal coordinates you wish to work with.  This is not recommended and
should only be done if you are an experienced user.

.IP "\fBIPRINT =\fP \fIinteger\fP"
A printing flag.  Setting this > 0 gives extra output. The default is 0.

.IP "\fBMORSE =\fP \fIboolean\fP"
If true, then increased accuracy in the numerical diagonal force
constants is to be achieved by approximate methods. The default is true.

.IP "\fBMORSE_VAL =\fP \fIinteger_vector\fP"
Used if MORSE is true, MORSE_VAL
is an vector of length NS, where NS is the number of symmetrized internal
coordinates.  Each element of MORSE_VAL can have the value 0, 1, or 2.   
The default is a vector with all elements equal to 2.  The meanings of the
integer elements are as follows:
.  iV                "= 0"   "No special procedure used.  The N-th order force"
.    __                      "constants are obtained via central difference"
.    __                      "formulas and (N-1)-th order analytic derivatives."
.  iV                "= 1"   "This value is appropriate for bond-stretching"
.    __                      "coordinates.  Either simple bond lengths or"
.    __                      "normalized symmetry bond lengths are possible."
.    __                      "The effect is to assume a Morse oscillator to"
.    __                      "reduce the numerical error in the"
.    __                      "finite-difference"
.    __                      "diagonal force constants.  (A"
.    __                      "reduction of the error by a factor of 5"
.    __                      "to 10 is typical.)"
.  iV                "= 2"   "This value is appropriate for any"
.    __                      "coordinate.  For the N-th order diagonal"
.    __                      "force constant, numerical values based on"
.    __                      "both (N-1)-th and (N-2)-th analytic"
.    __                      "derivatives are used to improve the"
.    __                      "accuracy.  (A reduction of the numerical"
.    __                      "error by a factor of 10 to 100 is typical"
.    __                      "for bond-stretching coordinates.)"

.IP "\fBSYMOPS =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The SYMOPS array is used to describe the symmetry operations needed to
generate all of the coordinates from thy symmetry unique set.
The format is as follows:

.DS
symops = (
  (ni (c1 c2 ..... cn))
   "   "  "         "
   "   "  "         "
  )
.DE

where ni is the coordinate generated by the ith symmetry operation, and
c1 is the coordinate into which coordinate 1 is sent by the ith symmetry
operation,
c2 is the coordinate into which coordinate 2 is sent by the ith symmetry
operation, and
cn is the coordinate into which coordinate n is sent by the ith symmetry
operation.  
The number of vectors in the SYMOPS array should be equal
to the number of redundant internal coordinates, and n should be equal
to the number of symmetrized internal coordinates.
Note, the symmetry operation chosen should be that which interchanges the
coordinate ni with the symmetry unique coordinate from which ni is generated.
The values c1-cn can be negative if a positive displacement for one coordinate
is mapped into a negative displacement for another
(perhaps the same) coordinate.
This defaults to the zero vector.


.IP "\fBPOS_DISP =\fP \fIinteger_array\fP"
The POS_DISP array gives information for internal coordinates for which
only positive displacements are needed.
The format is as follows:

.DS
pos_disp = (
  (ni (p1 p2 ..... pn))
   "   "  "         "
   "   "  "         "
  )
.DE

where ni is a coordinate for which only a positive displacement is given,
and 
p1 specifies the parity (+1 or -1) of coordinate 1 under the symmetry
operation which generates the -ni displacement from the +ni displacement,
p2 specifies the parity (+1 or -1) of coordinate 2 under the symmetry
operation which generates the -ni displacement from the +ni displacement,
etc.
The number of vectors in the POS_DISP array should be equal
to the number of internal coordinates for which only positive displacements
are needed, and n should be equal
to the number of symmetrized internal coordinates.
This defaults to the zero vector.
